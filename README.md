# tabula-muris-senis

The [**Tabula Muris Senis**](https://tabula-muris-senis.ds.czbiohub.org/) is a comprehensive resource for the cell biology community which offers a detailed molecular and cell-type specific portrait of aging. You can read our pre-print [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/661728v1)! We view such a cell atlas as an essential companion to the genome: the genome provides a blueprint for the organism but does not explain how genes are used in a cell type specific manner or how the usage of genes changes over the lifetime of the organism. The cell atlas provides a deep characterization of phenotype and physiology which can serve as a reference for understanding many aspects of the cell biological changes that mammals undergo during their lifespan.

**This is a resource for the community!** The repo is being continously updated with the code used for the publication - let us know your priorities and we will prioritze that code release!
