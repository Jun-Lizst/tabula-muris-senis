The **Tabula Muris Senis** is a comprehensive resource for the cell biology community which offers a detailed molecular and cell-type specific portrait of aging.  We view such a cell atlas as an essential companion to the genome: the genome provides a blueprint for the organism but does not explain how genes are used in a cell type specific manner or how the usage of genes changes over the lifetime of the organism. The cell atlas provides a deep characterization of phenotype and physiology which can serve as a reference for understanding many aspects of the cell biological changes that mammals undergo during their lifespan.
